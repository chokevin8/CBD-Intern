# Intern at Cowell Biodigm (CBD)
This repository contains the code that I worked on in R for my 2020 Intern at CBD. Not all codes/results are shown due to permissions.
My project was about taking in patient RNA-Seq Data and performing Differential Gene Expression Analysis and Pathway Analysis to potentially search for new possible drug targets. This is relevant to the company as the company is a drug discovery start-up that out-licenses or sells promising drug targets.
